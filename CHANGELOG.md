## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Light/dark theme toggle — respects system preference, persists choice to localStorage, and prevents flash of wrong theme on load.
- Astro page transitions using `ClientRouter` with a fade animation for smooth navigation between pages.
- Video Modal wrapper component with autoplay on open, pause on close, and support for YouTube, Vimeo, and local video sources.
- Image Carousel wrapper component with thumbnail navigation.
- `alternateSource` prop on the **Image** component — displays an alternate image when the site theme is toggled, useful for swapping logos or diagrams between light and dark mode.
- `size` prop on the **Text** component (xs through 4xl) — sets the font size of paragraphs and lists; headings retain their own sizing.
- `iconColor` prop on Button, Heading, Input, Select, Submit, and Content Selector components.
- New **Range** form component (`building-blocks/forms/range`).
- List items support an optional `link` URL
- Team Grid exposes a `layout` prop.
- Main site header and footer now include a **Components** link to `/component-docs/`.
- Select component displays a custom chevron-down icon replacing the native browser arrow and supports an optional leading `iconName` prop.
- Split, Bento Box, and Grid components now support `none` as a gap option.
- Blog posts now have tags and an archive of all posts with a given tag.
- All page sections that wrap `CustomSection` now accept the same shell props: `sectionLabel`, `maxContentWidth`, `paddingHorizontal`, `paddingVertical`, `colorScheme`, `backgroundColor`, and `background` (image/video with overlay).
- Button and Card `link` fields support a `^popover-id` convention (e.g. `^modal-my-video`) to open a modal via the native Popover API instead of navigating.
- Video component supports `background` mode for rendering decorative looping background video with autoplay, mute, and `prefers-reduced-motion` handling.
- Custom Section and Card `background` object supports an `overlay` value (−1.0 to 1.0) that renders a semi-transparent lighten/darken layer over the background image or video.
- `maxContentWidth` select on Custom Section and Card now includes a **None** option.
- Carousel supports `indicatorStyle="fraction"` to show a slide counter (e.g. `1/3`) instead of dots.
- Modal wrapper now supports an optional header title shown in the sticky top bar.
- Meta keywords: optional `keywords` string arrays in page and blog post frontmatter; when set, output as `<meta name="keywords">`. CloudCannon inputs and new-page/blog schemas include the field.
- Custom `404` page (`404.html` when built) with CloudCannon hosting routing in `.cloudcannon/routing.json` and `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` for the error page URL.
- Anchor links on component doc page headings (Overview, Properties, Slots, Examples, and each example group) for deep-linking to specific sections and examples.
- Toggle option for Navs to allow you to have a link on a node and select children.
- Carousel supports a `gap` prop to set the spacing between slides.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Renamed the Video component's `id` prop to `videoId` to avoid conflicts with the HTML `id` attribute. The same rename applies to the Video Modal component.
- **Breaking:** Button no longer accepts explicit `popovertarget` / `popovertargetaction` props. Pass them as HTML attributes when using `element="button"`, or use the new `^popover-id` link convention instead.
- **Breaking:** Button's `element` prop no longer defaults to `"a"`. The tag is now inferred: `<a>` when `link` is set, `<button>` otherwise. Pass `element` explicitly to override.
- **Breaking:** Standardized layout prop naming — `alignX` → `alignmentHorizontal`, `verticalAlignment` → `alignmentVertical`, Carousel `align` → `alignmentHorizontal`, Modal `header` → `heading`.
- **Breaking:** Custom Section and Card `backgroundImage` / `backgroundVideo` merged into one `background` object (`type`: `image` | `video`, shared position props, `imageSource` / `imageAlt`, `videoSource`).
- Dropped `lightningcss` as the CSS transformer — reverted to Vite's default (PostCSS + esbuild).
- Switched all component `<style>` blocks to `<style is:global>` and removed all `:global()` wrappers.
- Renamed `building-blocks/forms/slider` component to `building-blocks/forms/toggle`.
- **Embed** component now renders iframes in the visual editor`.
- Updated Twitter references to X.
- Video poster images from `src/assets/images` are now optimized with `getImage`, scaled to fit within 1920×1080.
- CloudCannon image uploads default to `src/assets/images` on the `pages` and `blog` collections.
- Blog Content Editor disables the native image toolbar button; authors add images via the Image snippet.
- FeatureGrid heading/text alignment is now configurable via `alignmentHorizontal` instead of being hardcoded to `center`.
- Blog Pagefind wiring markup for published date, author, article type, and tags.
- CloudCannon field comments and component docs now note that selectable UI icons are sourced from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).
- Lowered minimum Node.js version requirement from 24 to 22.
- Default font provider switched from `fontProviders.google()` to `fontProviders.fontsource()` in `site-fonts.mjs`.
- Logo aspect ratios in main nav stay visually balanced across desktop and mobile states.
- Third-level main nav items now use distinct styling to separate from second-level items.
- Text blocks now trim top margin from their first child and bottom margin from their last child.
- Modal examples now use `custom-section` for inner spacing; the modal wrapper no longer applies default body padding.
- Local video sources now automatically include matching sibling formats (`.webm`, `.ogv`).
- Base layout now renders SEO meta tags directly without relying on the `astro-seo` package.
- Blog posts now render `og:type="article"` plus article-specific Open Graph metadata.
- Component library routes (`/component-docs/*`) are excluded from the generated sitemap and use `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` so they are not indexed as public site content.
- Heading `iconName` and footer social link `icon` selects now use the visual icon picker (with name and SVG preview) instead of a plain dropdown or text input.
- Image component now prepends `sizes="auto"` for lazy-loaded images.

### Fixed

- Component docs mobile nav logo now matches the main site's logo size and nav bar height.
- **Icon** component background color now wraps tightly around the icon instead of stretching full width.
- **ContentSelector** Astro code generation in docs now works correctly — the content-selector-specific branch runs as intended and adds `checked` to the first `ContentSelectorPanel`.
- Main navigation desktop layout now adds spacing between nav links and the header button group via flex `gap`.
- Component docs Astro code tab now renders all named slots from component metadata as `<Fragment slot="...">` children. Fixes Card Before & After examples.
- CloudCannon `data` collection now sets `disable_url: true` so automatic output URL matching does not assign incorrect preview URLs to non-page data files.
- Carousel indicator dots now use presentational `<div>` elements instead of `<button>`, fixing invalid `aria-selected`.
- Navigation dropdown `<label>` triggers no longer use invalid `role="button"`.
- Modal scrollbar now only applies to the body content, keeping the header fixed outside the scroll area.
- List items with icons now align wrapped text to the text column instead of wrapping under the icon.
- Button now forwards link attributes (`target`, `rel`, etc.) and button attributes (`type`, `disabled`, etc.) to the inner element instead of the wrapper.
- Carousel: `loop={false}` now correctly disables Embla loop.
- Opening a modal now locks page scrolling until the modal is closed.
- Image component now always keeps at least one valid responsive width candidate.
- Structured data no longer emits an empty `description` field when the site SEO description has not been set.
- Blog index and tag archive pagination pages now use unique document titles (append “– Page N” for page 2 and up) instead of repeating the first-page title.
- Content selector mobile views
- Excluded the **Pagination** component from being added to components.
- Carousel now works correctly in the CloudCannon visual editor.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Reset button in Component Builder that clears all state and returns to the Build tab.
- Bento Box component for asymmetric grid layouts where items can span multiple columns and rows.
- Input component now supports optional leading and trailing icons in ACS.
- Font setup is centralized in `site-fonts.mjs` with `SiteFonts.astro`
- Modal component for dialog overlays, using the Popover API with CSS animations and minimal JS for accessibility.
- Button component now supports `popovertarget` and `popovertargetaction` props, forwarding them to the inner element.

### Changed

- Exported Astro components now use scoped `<style>` instead of `<style is:global>`.
- CSS uses Vite's default pipeline (PostCSS for processing, esbuild for minification) instead of opting into Lightning CSS for transform while minifying with esbuild.
- Raised Vite `chunkSizeWarningLimit` to 1024 kB so builds don't warn on expected large chunks (e.g. Shiki in component docs).

### Fixed

- ComponentViewer Astro code preview now renders child items for BentoBox and Masonry components instead of showing self-closing tags.
- Component Builder sandbox delete button styles: replace Sass-style `&-delete` nesting with a flat `.sandbox-item-btn.sandbox-item-btn-delete` selector so esbuild CSS minify doesn't warn on invalid nesting.
- SVGO icon optimization: use `cleanupIds` override (SVGO 4 plugin name) so disabling ID cleanup no longer prints a preset warning at build time.
- Bento Box item column/row span changes now update visually in the CloudCannon editor.
- Icon component no longer exposes an unsupported `4xl` size option.
- Image component no longer converts SVGs to WebP — SVGs are now served as-is.
- Button component no longer relies on `display: contents` on its root wrapper.
- Definition list items no longer rely on `display: contents` on their root wrapper.
- Content selector items now use camelCase `iconName` and `subtext` fields for optional icons and supporting text.
- Heading icons now stay inline with heading text so titles wrap naturally after the icon.
- Heading icons now render at `0.9em` to better match heading text sizing.
- Content selector tabs now keep `aria-selected` and panel `aria-hidden` in sync as panels are switched.
- Content selector top navigation now shows a subtle muted underline on inactive items to match the start navigation style.
- Side navigation now shows the active link underline when `aria-current="page"` is set.
- Fix case where List doesn't work when using slot
